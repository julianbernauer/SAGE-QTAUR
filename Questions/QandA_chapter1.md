1. What is a corpus, and how do we create one?
   A text corpus is defined as "A corpus class object containing the original texts, document-level variables, document-level metadata, corpus-level metadata, and default settings for subsequent processing of the corpus" (see https://quanteda.io/reference/corpus.html). It can be created using the `corpus()` command in the *quanteda* R package.See "https://tutorials.quanteda.io/basic-operations/corpus" for further tutorials. A corpus is very useful in QTA as it allows to access the units of text of interest and their properties. 


3. Do you need to rely on tidyverse to perform QTA?


4. What is Git good for?

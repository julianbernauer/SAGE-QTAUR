The book is mainly build on R code, but also contains some Python. 

Please feel free to contact us for feedback or questions or if you find any errors in the code. We are happy to consider any suggestions for improvement, simply submit a pull request. 

##  Accessing R files 
You can learn more about Github in Chapter 1 of the book. Here, we want to quickly explain how to get the code from GitHub into an R project on your computer:
1) download git onto your computer: https://git-scm.com/
2) in R, navigate to git under Tools > Global Options and check the version control box
3) add the directory where you just installed Git in the Git executable field
4) on the GitHub landing page of this repository, click on the green "code" button
5) copy the URL under HTTPS. Alternatively, you can create an SSH key for RStudio and use that URL
6) go to File > New Project > Version Control > Git, and in the Repository URL field, input the link you copied
7) through "browse" determine where our code should be stored on your local machine
8) click ‘Create Project’
